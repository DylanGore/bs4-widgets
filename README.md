This is a Wordpress plugin created to add [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com) components and content as widgets to SiteOrigin's [PageBuilder](https://siteorigin.com/page-builder/).

**Important Note:** At this time, the plugin assumes that Bootstrap 4 is included with the active theme. Therefore, if Bootstrap 4 is *not* included in the active theme, this plugin will not work at this time. This is a temporary measure which I plan to fix soon.

## Included Widgets
*All links go to Bootstrap 4 documentation pages.*
* [Alert](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/)
* Break (Standard HTML 5 ``<hr>`` and ``<br>`` tags, added for convenience)
* [Button](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/)
* [Card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/)
* [Display Heading](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/typography/#display-headings)
* [Heading](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/typography/#headings)
* [Paragraph](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/typography/#lead) (Standard HTML 5 ``<p>`` tag as well as Bootstrap 4 ``.lead`` paragraph)
